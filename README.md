# PyATM-A-Console-Based-ATM-Simulator-in-Python
PyATM is a simple command-line ATM simulation project developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It mimics basic ATM functionalities like checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing cash after PIN authentication. The program uses encapsulation, classes, and methods to organize logic in a clean, reusable manner.
